fourdtictactoe
==============

An implementation of 4D tic tac toe (or noughts and crosses for you weirdos) in python with kivy.

The basic gui setup is adapted from that written by Alexander Taylor (inclement) that I found here: http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/build-tic-tac-toe-with-kivy. 

Requires: python 2.7, kivy 1.8, numpy 1.8.1
